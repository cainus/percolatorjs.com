          <p>
          Percolator handles the boring details for you to keep you working on the fun stuff -- 
          Details like:
          <ul>
            <li>JSON parsing and validation</li>
            <li>JSON serialization, response statuses, and error messages</li>
            <li>RESTful niceness, including hypermedia.</li>
          </ul>
        If your current framework doesn&apos;t help you with this stuff then we'd
        like you to know that 2004 called and it wants it&apos;s ridiculous 
        level-of-abstraction back.

          <h3>APIs that no one will laugh at.</h3>
          <p>Most JSON APIs are ridiculously non-standard, sloppy, and 
          inconsistent.  If you write another one of those, everyone 
          will laugh at you and you won't be able to eat lunch with the 
          cool kids.  Instead, Percolator can help you create surfable 
          JSON-REST APIs with standardized response formats and error 
          messages that might even make your client developers stop plotting your murder.

          <h3>CRUD without the Crap</h3>
          <p>Percolator includes powerful resource-oriented CRUD support that abstracts the API details even 
          further so that you're only spending your time on your app&apos;s core 
          business logic.   Alternatively, you could keep hand-coding all that API and CRUD logic
          over and over, but you might want to ask why you hate yourself so much.  We think you're
          pretty fantastic.</p>
